# Surviving-Wheels


This is a game project developed for a subject named Elements of Computer Graphics.

Basically this game is about a driver (you) that spawns inside the University Campus which has been taken over by zombies.
Your mission? 
You have to survive the zombie apocalypse, they will find you and they will kill you so watch your back!

Have fun!
